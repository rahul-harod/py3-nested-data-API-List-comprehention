    "# The Internet: Behind the Scenes\n",
    "The Internet is a transport mechanism that lets any connected device communicate with any other connected device. Behind the scenes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each device has a globally distinct IP address, which is a 32 bit number. Usually an IP address is represented as a sequence of four decimal numbers, each number in the range (0, 255). For example, when I checked the IP address for my laptop just now, it was 141.211.203.248. Any IP address beginning with 141.211 is for a device at the University of Michigan. When I take my laptop home and connect to a network there, my laptop gets a different IP address that it uses there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is chopped up into reasonable sized packets (up to 65,535 bytes, but usually much smaller).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data packet has a header that includes the destination IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each packet is routed independently, getting passed on from one computing device to another until it reaches its destination. The computing devices that do that packet forwarding are called routers. Each router keeps an address table that says, when it gets a packet for some destination address, which of its neighbors should it pass the packet on to. The routers are constantly talking to each other passing information about how they should update their routing tables. The system was designed to be resistant to any local damage. If some of the routers stop working, the rest of the routers talk to each other and start routing packets around in a different way so that packets still reach their intended destination if there is some path to get there. It is this technical capability that has spawned metaphoric quotes like this one from John Gilmore: “The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "At the destination, the packets are reassembled into the original data message.\n",

    "# Anatomy of URLs\n",
    "A URL is used by a browser or other program to specify what server to connect to and what page to ask for. Like other things that will be interpreted by computer programs, URLs have a very specific formal structure. If you put a colon in the wrong place, the URL won’t work correctly. The overall structure of a URL is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"<scheme>://<host>:<port>/<path>\"\"\"\n",
    "Usually, the scheme will be http or https. The s in https stands for “secure”. When you use https, all of the communication between the two devices is encrypted. Any devices that intercepts some of the packets along the way will be unable to decrypt the contents and figure out what the data was.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other schemes that you will sometimes see include ftp (for file transfer) and mailto (for email addresses).\n",
    "\n",
    "The host will usually be a domain name, like si.umich.edu or github.com or google.com. When the URL specifies a domain name, the first thing the computer program does is look up the domain name to find the 32-bit IP address. For example, right now the IP adddress for github.com is 192.30.252.130. This could change if, for example, github moved its servers to a different location or contracted with a different Internet provider. Lookups use something called the Domain Name System, or DNS for short. Changes to the mapping from domain names to IP addresses can take a little while to propagate: if github.com announces a new IP address associated with its domain, it might take up to 24 hours for some computers to start translating github.com to the new IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, the host can be an IP address directly. This is less common, because IP addresses are harder to remember and because a URL containing a domain name will continue to work even if the remote server keeps its domain name but moves to a different IP address.\n",
    "\n",
    "The :port is optional. If it is omitted, the default port number is 80. The port number is used on the receiving end to decide which computer program should get the data that has been received. We probably will not encounter any URLs that include the : and a port number in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The /path is also optional. It specifies something about which page, or more generally which contents, are being requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the url https://github.com/presnick/runestone:\n",
    "\n",
    "https:// says to use the secure http protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "github.com says to connect to the server at github.com, which currently maps to the IP address 192.30.252.130. The connection will be made on the default port, which is 443 for https.\n",
    "\n",
    "/presnick/runestone says to ask the remote server for the page presnick/runestone. It is up to the remote server to decide how to map that to the contents of a file it has access to, or to some content that it generates on the fly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The url http://blueserver.com/path?k=val is another example that we can consider. The path here a bit different from https://github.com/presnick/runestone because it includes what are called “query parameters”, the information after the ?."

    "Using REST APIs\n",
    "REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It originally had a more abstract meaning, but has come to be a shorthand name for web sites that act a bit like python functions, taking as inputs values for certain parameters and producing outputs in the form of a long text string.\n",
    "\n",
    "API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API specifies how an external program (an application program) can request that a program perform certain computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting the two together, a REST API specifies how external programs can make HTTP requests to a web site in order to request that some computation be carried out and data returned as output. When a website is designed to accept requests generated by other computer programs, and produce outputs to be consumed by other programs, it is sometimes called a web service, as opposed to a web site which produces output meant for humans to consume in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, a web browser is just a computer program, so all requests to web sites come from other computer programs. But usually a browser requests data from a web site in order to display it directly to a human user of the browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to the development of REST APIs, there were other ways that computer programs made remote requests to other computers on a network, asking them to perform some computation or retrieve some data. Those other techniques are still in use. REST APIs are particularly convenient, however, both for students and for others, because it is easy to see what is going on in a request and a response between two computers, and thus it is easier to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will examine a common pattern used in REST APIs, where there is a base URL that defines an “endpoint”, and then additional information is appended to the URL as query parameters, and the response comes back not as HTML but as a format called JSON. Along the way, we will see some functions in python modules that are helpful for constructing the URLS and for processing the JSON formatted response.\n",
    "\n",
    "24.5.1. URL Structure for REST APIs\n",
    "In a REST API, the client or application program– the kind of program you will be writing– makes an HTTP request that includes information about what kind of request it is making. Web sites are free to define whatever format they want for how the request should be formatted. This chapter covers a particularly common and particularly simple format, where the request information is encoded right in the URL. This is convenient, because if something goes wrong, we can debug by copying the URL into a browser and see what happens when it tries to visit that URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this format, the URL has a standard structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "the base URL\n",
    "\n",
    "a ? character\n",
    "\n",
    "one or more key-value pairs, formatted as key=value pairs and separated by the & character.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the URL https://itunes.apple.com/search?term=Ann+Arbor&entity=podcast. Try copying that URL into a browser, or just clicking on it. It retrieves data about podcasts posted from Ann Arbor, MI. Depending on your browser, it may put the contents into a file attachment that you have to open up to see the contents, or it may just show the contents in a browser window.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s pull apart that URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "the base URL: https://itunes.apple.com/search\n",
    "\n",
    "a ? character\n",
    "\n",
    "key=value pairs. In this case, there are two pairs. The keys are term and entity. An & separates the two pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "../_images/parameterformat.png\n",
    "All those parts are concatenated together to form the full URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "../_images/urlstructure.png\n",
    "Note that in the search term Ann Arbor, the space had to be “encoded” as +. More on that below.\n",
    "\n",
    "24.5.2. Encoding URL Parameters\n",
    "Here’s another URL that has a similar format. https://www.google.com/search?q=%22violins+and+guitars%22&tbm=isch. It’s a search on Google for images that match the string “violins and guitars”. It’s not actually based on a REST API, because the contents that come back are meant to be displayed in a browser. But the URL has the same structure we have been exploring above and introduces the idea of “encoding” URL parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The base URL is https://www.google.com/search\n",
    "\n",
    "?\n",
    "\n",
    "Two key=value parameters, separated by &\n",
    "q=%22violins+and+guitars%22 says that the query to search for is “violins and guitars”.\n",
    "\n",
    "tbm=isch says to go to the tab for image search\n",
    "\n",
    "Now why is \"violins and guitars\" represented in the URL as %22violins+and+guitars%22? The answer is that some characters are not safe to include, as is, in URLs. For example, a URL path is not allowed to include the double -quote character. It also can’t include a : or / or a space. Whenever we want to include one of those characters in a URL, we have to encode them with other characters. A space is encoded as +. \" is encoded as %22. : would be encoded as %3A. And so on.\n"

    "The page-specific cache is a new file that is created the first time you make a request for a url that wasn’t in the permanent cache. Each subsequent request for a new url results in more data being written to the page-specific cache. After you run an activecode that adds something to the page-specific cache, you’ll see a little window below it where you can inspect the contents of the page-specific cache. When you reload the webpage, that page-specific cache will be gone; hence the name.\n",

These are keys from the parameters dictionary that should be ignored when deciding whether the current request matches a previous request. The main purpose of this is that it allows us to return a result from the cache for some REST APIs that would otherwise require you to provide an API key in order to make a request. By default, it is set to [“api_key”], which is a query parameter used with the flickr API. You should not need to set this optional parameter"

    "# Unicode for non-English characters¶\n",
    "Sometimes, you may need to deal with text that includes characters that are not part of the standard English alphabet, such as é, ö, Ф, or ¥. This is especially likely if you use REST APIs to fetch user-contributed content from social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or flickr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s strings are in unicode, which allows for characters to be from a much larger alphabet, including more than 75,000 ideographic characters used in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean alphabets. Everything works fine inside Python, for operations like slicing and appending and concatenating strings and using .find() or the in operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things only get tricky when you want to input strings into Python, or print them to an output window or write them to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "For output, your terminal (output) window will typically be set up to display characters only from a restricted set of languages (perhaps just English). If you issue a print statement on a string containing other characters, it may not display correctly in your terminal window. Indeed, you may get an error message. We will offer a workaround later on this page.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to store unicode text in a file, you have to choose an “encoding”. This is analogous to the encoding of special characters in a URL string, but not the same. In a file, each unicode character has to be encoded as one or more “bytes” for storage in a file. We have avoided low-level details about data encodings until now, but understanding a little about bits and bytes will help make sense of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "A bit is a BInary digiT. It is a single value restricted to two (binary) possibilities, which we conventionally write as 0 or 1. Computers store bits as electrical charges (high or low voltage) or as magnetic polarities, or some other way that we need not be concerned about. A sequence of eight 0-1 bits is called a byte. For example: 01001000.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 2^^8=256 distinct eight-bit bytes. If we only had 256 possible letters in our alphabet, we could simply encode each letter as one of the available bytes. When we restrict ourselves to regular python strings, using only the ASCII alphabet (English, plus a few special characters), the encoding is that simple, so simple that we haven’t had to think about it before.\n",
    "\n",
    "When there are 75,000 possible characters, they can’t all be encoded with a single byte, because there are only 256 distinct bytes (eight-bit sequences). There are many possible encodings. The one you will be most likely to encounter, using REST APIs, is called UTF-8. A single unicode character is mapped to a sequence of up to four bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you read in a UTF-8 encoded text, and get the contents using .read() or .readlines(), you will need to “decode” the contents in order to turn it into a proper unicode string that you can read and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the requests module will normally handle this for us automatically. When we fetch a webpage that is in json format, the webpage will have a header called ‘content-type’ that will say something like application/json; charset=utf8. If it specifies the utf8 character set in that way, the requests module will automatically decode the contents into unicode: requests.get('that web page').text will yield a string, with each of those sequences of one to four bytes coverted into a single character.\n",
    "\n",
    "If, for some reason, you get json-formatted text that is utf-encoded but the requests module hasn’t magically decoded it for you, the json.loads() function call can take care of the decoding for you. loads() takes an optional parameter, encoding. Its default value is ‘utf-8’, so you don’t need to specify it unless you think the text you have received was in some other encoding than ‘utf-8’.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "You may see a u before the string in a Python 2.7 program indicating that it’s a unicode string. In Python 3, all strings are unicode strings, so you shouldn’t encounter any of those strange u characters in this textbook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have python strings, everything will work fine until you try to print or write the contents to a file. If you print, and your terminal window is not set up to display that language, you may get a strange output, or an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to write to a file with unicode strings, you may get an error. When you write a unicode string to a file, Python tries to encode it in ASCII. If there is a non-ASCII character, the execution fails and raises an error that looks like this: UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\\xea' in position 1: ordinal not in range(128).\n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to use the Python method to encode the string, using a format such as utf-8. For example, s.encode('utf-8') will encode string s as utf-8. That will encode non-ASCII characters with multiple character sequences that are difficult for people to read but can decoded back into single Unicode characters. This is often the best way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another quick-and-dirty option, if you just have a few stray characters that are getting in your way, is to replace any non-ASCII characters with question marks. For example, s.encode('ascii', 'replace'). Of course, replacing characters with question marks destroys some of the information, but it may be helpful in some circumstances."
